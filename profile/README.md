# Jayzie.Dev

We build custom scripts for **FiveM** and **Minecraft** — focused on performance, clean code, and real server needs.

No bloated features.  
No copy-paste junk.  
Just scripts that actually work in production servers.

## What We Do
- FiveM scripts (ESX / QBCore / custom frameworks)
- Minecraft plugins & systems
- Custom features based on your server concept
- Optimization & refactoring existing scripts

We care about:
- Stability over gimmicks
- Readable, maintainable code
- Easy integration into live servers

## Why Jayzie.Dev
Most scripts fail after a few weeks because they’re rushed or over-engineered.  
We take a different approach — build only what’s needed, test it properly, and keep it scalable.

If your server grows, the script shouldn’t break.

## Repositories
Some repositories here are public demos or internal tools.  
Production scripts may stay private or limited.
